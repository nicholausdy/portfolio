Title       | Traffic-load-responsive Intersection Management for Mixed-traffic Conditions
-----       | -----------------
Summary     | Formulated a novel traffic-load-responsive method to manage a mixed-traffic intersection, e.g., an intersection containing connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) and non-connected vehicles (NCVs), by utilizing our novel Traffic-Adjusted Least Laxity First (TALLF) scheduling.

Title                    | Mixed-traffic Intersection Management using Traffic-load-responsive Reservation and V2X-enabled Speed Coordination
-----                    | -----------------
Summary                  | A novel cluster-based reservation for mixed-traffic intersections with traffic-load-responsive scheduling. V2X communication is also added to enable CAVs to reach the optimal crossing speed.
